22961895	2012	PCR diagnostics detected 100% prevalence of Helicobacter in 425 wild house mice (Mus musculus) from across Central Europe. Of seven species identified, the five most frequent were H. rodentium (78%), H. typhlonius (53%), H. hepaticus (41%), H. bilis (30%) and H. muridarum (1%). Double infections were more common (42%) than single (30%) and triple (21%) infections. Wild house mice could be considered potential reservoirs of Helicobacter for both humans and other vertebrates.
