Provenance Corpus
=================

This is the [Wf4Ever](http://www.wf4ever-project.org/) Provenance corpus.
The corpus is [maintained at GitHub](https://github.com/wf4ever/taverna-prov).
For more information, read about the [Provenance corpus in the Wf4Ever
wiki](http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/Provenance+corpus).

Each of the folders represent a [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk/) 
workflow from [myExperiment](http://www.myexperiment.org/). The folders
are called for instance `workflow_2759-version_2` representing version _2_ of workflow
_2759_on myExperiment - ie.
http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/2759/versions/2

Within the workflow folder, different workflow runs are shown as 
`run1`, `run2` etc, each containing the provenance output of 
export using the [Taverna-Prov plugin](https://github.com/wf4ever/taverna-prov), 
including the workflow output values, the [PROV-O
RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) of the provenance in
`workflowrun.prov.ttl`, and the intermediate values in `intermediates/`.

Each workflow identifies the credited author(s) as stated on the
corresponding myExperiment page in `CREDITS.txt`.


Licensing
---------

Each workflow has separate copyright and licensing information. The
file `LICENSE.txt` should be a symlink to the appropriate license
from the `licenses/` folder. It is currently unclear if the license for a
workflow extends to its provenance outputs; as the provenance trace will
contain parts of the workflow definition (namely processor names and
ports) and could be used to recreate a partial workflow definition, it
could be considered "derived work". 

The intermediate and resulting data might be covered by separate
licenses for the services invoked by the workflow.
