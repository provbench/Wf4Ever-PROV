Mitochondrial cholesterol is maintained within a narrow range to regulate steroid and oxysterol synthesis and to ensure mitochondrial function. Mitochondria acquire cholesterol through several pathways from different cellular pools. Here we have characterized mitochondrial import of endosomal cholesterol using Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a CYP11A1 fusion protein that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone at the mitochondrial inner membrane. RNA interference-mediated depletion of the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in the mitochondrial outer membrane, or of Niemann-Pick Type C2 (NPC2) in the endosome lumen decreased arrival of cholesterol at the mitochondrial inner membrane. Expression of NPC2 mutants unable to transfer cholesterol to NPC1 still restored mitochondrial cholesterol import in NPC2-depleted cells. Transport assays in semi-permeabilized cells showed non-vesicular cholesterol trafficking directly from endosomes to mitochondria that did not require cytosolic transport proteins, but that was reduced in the absence of NPC2. Our findings indicate that NPC2 delivers cholesterol to the perimeter membrane of late endosomes where it becomes available for transport to mitochondria without requiring NPC1.
