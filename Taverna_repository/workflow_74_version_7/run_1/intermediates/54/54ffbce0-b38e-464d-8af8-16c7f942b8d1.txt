The amyloid beta-precursor protein (APP) and the Notch receptor are both type 1 integral transmembrane proteins, and both are cleaved by presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase activity. In this study, we have demonstrated that the Notch intracellular domain (Notch1-IC) suppresses APP-intracellular domain (AICD)-mediated ROS generation and cell death after being processed by gamma secretase. Notch1-IC physically interacts with AICD, Fe65, and Tip60, thereby disrupting the association of the AICD-Fe65-Tip60 trimeric transcription activator complex in AICD signaling. AICD-Fe65-Tip60 mediated reactive oxygen species generation was found to be suppressed by Notch1-IC. Furthermore, AICD-Fe65-Tip60 was shown to mediate cell death in human neuroblastoma cells, and the overexpression of Notch1-IC inhibited cell death induced by AICD-Fe65-Tip60. Collectively, our findings indicate that Notch1-IC plays the role of a negative regulator in AICD signaling via the disruption of the AICD-Fe65-Tip60 trimeric complex.
