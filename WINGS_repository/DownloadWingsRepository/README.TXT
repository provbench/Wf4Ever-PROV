This program I used to download the repository.
It performs a series of queries to retrieve the contents of each template and execution related to PROV.
The program connects to the Wings repository (http://opmw.org/sparql), so if you are
looking for additional contents and more complete traces I encourage you to take a look.

How to use the jar? Just Download the jar and lib in the same folder and execute the .jar.
The program will take some time (depending on your internet connection), and it will 
create a folder with the same structure seen in the Github Repository.
